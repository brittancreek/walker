Feature: Peripheral Stimulation

Peripheral Recognition
Angular motion speed to determine LED step rate.
Color considerations? 550nM green?

“Area prostriata responds strongly to very fast motion, greater than 500°/s. The functional properties of area prostriata suggest that it may serve to alert the brain quickly to fast visual events, particularly in the peripheral visual field.”
John, I bet we can evaluate, we should have no problem rotating around our ring at 720 Deg/sec. 2 full rotations of one led of 12 = 2x 360. 360/12 is 30 deg/step which exceeds ARL minimum recognition. if I interpreted correctly.
