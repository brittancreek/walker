Feature: Device Characteristics

As Brittan Creek, I want to specify stuff - end of story.

JC: can use this to generate the lib/colors.py contents and device configurations.


JC: This from a project proposal write-up in the archives

    Easy Control, Customization and Identification
Preamble
The following expressions were captured in a prospective customer interview as they brainstormed the features of an imaginary device, sparked by an agreement that one downside of being independent of a walking cane is that one is not recognized as an an individual that might need a little extra consideration.
• Emoji • fun
• noticeable
• Figurine of person with cane
• Draw kids' attention
• The problem is visibility
• (Helper) Dog image
• "I nurture what little I have left of the kid in me, and value the cool things".
Argument
• Immediately apparent here is that any kind wearable device needs to have customizable visual appeal. The object needs to be a tool that the user can make their own. The very definition of an enchant-able object.
• Our core demographic requires that any control interface needs to be as close to telepathic as we can make it, and a touch screen interface should be our development platform to develop a more generalized UI that might include eye movement capture, and other subtle methods of machine/human interaction.
• Any Brittan Creek device needs to be over-the-air (OTA) updatable at the consent of the user. This interface again will need to cater for differently-abled users, and requires a pyboard-compatible development platform.

Feature: color

Hue is the term for color in science. Red Green and Blue are Additive primaries that respond to the Cones in our central/Foveal vision. Electronics like TVs and screens use Additive Primaries.
Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and sometimes extra black named K for Japanese Kuro (black)  are Subtractive primaries hence CMYK in color printing.

As an engineer, I want to specify light color in RGB values ordered as the LED, or other device requires
