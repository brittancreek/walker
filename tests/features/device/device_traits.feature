Feature: Device Traits

# JC: This from a project proposal write-up in the archives

# Easy Control, Customization and Identification
# Preamble
# The following expressions were captured in a prospective
# customer interview as they brainstormed the features of an
# imaginary device, sparked by an agreement that one downside
# of #being independent of a walking cane is that one is not #recognized as an an individual that might need a little extra #consideration.
#• Emoji • fun
#• noticeable
#• Figurine of person with cane
#• Draw kids' attention
#• The problem is visibility
#• (Helper) Dog image
#• "I nurture what little I have left of the kid in me, and #value the cool things".
#Argument
#• Immediately apparent here is that any kind wearable device #needs to have customizable visual appeal. The object needs to #be a tool that the user can make their own. The very #definition of an enchant-able object.
#• Our core demographic requires that any control interface #needs to be as close to telepathic as we can make it, and a #touch screen interface should be our development platform to #develop a more generalized UI that might include eye movement #capture, and other subtle methods of machine/human interaction.
#• Any Brittan Creek device needs to be over-the-air (OTA) #updatable at the consent of the user. This interface again #will need to cater for differently-abled users, and requires a #pyboard-compatible development platform.ß

JC: would include form factor I would think
