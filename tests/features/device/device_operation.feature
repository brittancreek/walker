Feature: Device Operation
    In order to know that my device is activating successfully
    As a device user
    I want a bunch of feedback

    DM: part of my vision was to have no on/off switch but rather a touch sensitive switch. we should have an RTC based interrupt detection we can use. e.g. tap the device and 'beam me up Scotty'



Ambient Light Sensing

The device needs to device to adapt to its surroundings of Day/night and to detect headlight illumination and make the right choices of how best to use battery power while stiull meeting the visibility requirements.

Hardware solution can involve photo sensors at orthogonal angles and logic/interrupts to change modes in sub second response.

Daytime, nighttime, and headlight illumination modes should be considered.


Thermal Sensing (scenario)
Do we need to incorporate thermal conditions in the future? Snow, black ice risks?
