@v1.0
Feature: Device Operation
    In order to know that my device is activating successfully
    As a device user
    I want a bunch of feedback

    DM: part of my vision was to have no on/off switch but rather a touch sensitive switch. we should have an RTC based interrupt detection we can use. e.g. tap the device and 'beam me up Scotty'
