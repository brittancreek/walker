Feature: startup
    In order to know that my device is activating successfully
    As a device user
    I want a bunch of feedback

    DM: part of my vision was to have no on/off switch but rather a touch sensitive switch. we should have an RTC based interrupt detection we can use. e.g. tap the device and 'beam me up Scotty'

- [ ] Minimal self-awareness
- [ ] Can I log?
- [ ] What is the ambient light level?
- [ ] Touch on/off sensor/switch. Do we boot up, initialize and then go into a wait mode?

### Peripheral Recognition
- [ ] Angular motion speed to determine LED step rate.
- [ ] Color considerations?

### Day-Night Mode
- [ ] Photo sensor for day/night operation
-- infinite loop mode
-- is it day or are we in a headlight beam?
-- more complex than binary
- [ ] Keys off ambient light level in Bootstrap
- [ ] Implies thread monitoring light level
