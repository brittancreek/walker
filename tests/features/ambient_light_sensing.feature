Feature: Ambient Light Sensing

The device needs to device to adapt to its surroundings of Day/night and to detect headlight illumination and make the right choices of how best to use battery power while stiull meeting the visibility requirements.

Hardware solution can involve photo sensors at orthogonal angles and logic/interrupts to change modes in sub second response.

Daytime, nighttime, and headlight illumination modes should be considered.
